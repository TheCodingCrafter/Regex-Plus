SYNTAX:

NOTE qoutes are NOT used, spaces are the delimiter.
NOTE iterators use SINGLE CHARS.

SELECT KEYWORD:
essentialy an output keyword, sets output to be the procedding value
often used like so:

SELECT * FROM
where:
    * = everything
    FROM = FROM keyword


* can be replaced with a number to select a certain amount of data
data comes in a list format, SELECT 6, will select the first 6 data points
use negative numbers to select from the end of the list
SELECT -3, selects the last elements

use FROM to specify where to get the data from:

SELECT * FROM %I WHERE:I %x NOT NUM
where:
    %I = Input var
    %x = iterator var

the above scipt takes input and gets everything that is not a number
% is used to indicate a variable
%<v> = <v> with <v> being the variable name

below names are reserved:
    %I = input
    %x = iterator


WHERE KEYWORD:
the WHERE keyword is similar to an if statement, and has several modes
specify mode with

WHERE:<m>
where:
    <m> = mode

modes:
    I = iterator
    C = comparision (if statement WHERE:C <condition>)
